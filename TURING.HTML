    <P>During 1941, codebreaking at Bletchley Park was hindered by shortages of typists
        and unskilled staV. These shortages could have been easily rectiWed, but the
        codebreakers’ urgent requests were ignored by oYcials in Whitehall. Going over
        the heads of those in command at GC & CS, Turing and his co-signatories wrote
        directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. On receiving the letter
        Churchill minuted his Chief of StaV, General Ismay: ‘action this day
        Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that
        this had been done.’1
        It fell to Stuart Milner-Barry of Hut 6 to deliver the letter by hand to 10
        Downing Street. In 1986, Milner-Barry recalled his trip to Whitehall:
        Why I was deputed to carry the letter to No. 10 I do not remember—at a guess, because I
        was the most readily expendable from the scene of action. What I do recall is arriving at
        Euston Station, hailing a taxi, and with a sense of total incredulity (can this really be
        happening?) inviting the driver to take me to 10 Downing Street. The taxi-driver never
        blinked an eyelid: without comment he directed himself to Whitehall. Arrived at the
        entrance to Downing Street, I was again surprised at the lack of formality: there was just a
        wooden barrier across the road, and one uniformed policeman who waved my driver on.
        At the door to No. 10 I paid oV the taxi, rang the bell, was courteously ushered in,
        explained that I had an urgent letter which I was anxious to deliver to the Prime Minister</P>
    <section id="footer">1 Both the letter and Churchill’s minute appear in F. H. Hinsley et al., British Intelligence in the Second
            World War, vol. ii (London: Her Majesty’s Stationery OYce, 1981), appendix 3, pp. 655–7. A facsimile of

    <p>personally, and was invited to wait. Of course I did not see the Prime Minister himself;
                but very shortly there appeared a dapper dark-suited Wgure of shortish stature whom
                I subsequently identiWed as Brigadier Harvie-Watt, Mr. Churchill’s PPS from 1941 to
                1945. To him I again explained my errand; and while obviously and understandably
                puzzled as to who I might be and what this was all about, he took me suYciently seriously
                to promise that he would without fail deliver the letter to the Prime Minister and stress its
                urgency. That accomplished, I took my leave and took myself back to Bletchley by the next
                train. It was some forty years later before I found out what happened to that letter, when I
                saw the Prime Minister’s minute dated the following day. . . All that we did notice was
                that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. The
                Xow of bombes was speeded up, the staV bottlenecks were relieved, and we were able to
                devote ourselves uninterruptedly to the business in hand.2
                Milner-Barry added, ‘I by chance met Commander Denniston in the corridors
                some days later, and he made some rather wry remark about our unorthodox
                behaviour; but he was much too nice a man to bear malice.’</p>

    <p>Dear Prime Minister,
            Some weeks ago you paid us the honour of a visit, and we believe that you
            regard our work as important. You will have seen that, thanks largely to the
            energy and foresight of Commander Travis, we have been well supplied with the
            ‘bombes’ for the breaking of the German Enigma codes. We think, however, that
            you ought to know that this work is being held up, and in some cases is not being
            done at all, principally because we cannot get suYcient staV to deal with it. Our
            reason for writing to you direct is that for months we have done everything that
            we possibly can through the normal channels, and that we despair of any early
            improvement without your intervention. No doubt in the long run these particular requirements will be met, but meanwhile still more precious months will
            have been wasted, and as our needs are continually expanding we see little hope
            of ever being adequately staVed.
            We realise that there is a tremendous demand for labour of all kinds and that
            its allocation is a matter of priorities. The trouble to our mind is that as we are a
            very small section with numerically trivial requirements it is very diYcult to
            bring home to the authorities Wnally responsible either the importance of what is
            done here or the urgent necessity of dealing promptly with our requests. At the
            same time we Wnd it hard to believe that it is really impossible to produce quickly
            the additional staV that we need, even if this meant interfering with the normal
            machinery of allocations.
            We do not wish to burden you with a detailed list of our diYculties, but the
            following are the bottlenecks which are causing us the most acute anxiety.</p>
    <section id="first">1. Breaking of Naval Enigma (Hut 8)</section>
    <p>Owing to shortage of staV and the overworking of his present team the Hollerith
                section here under Mr Freeborn has had to stop working night shifts. The eVect
                of this is that the Wnding of the naval keys is being delayed at least twelve hours
                every day. In order to enable him to start night shifts again Freeborn needs
                immediately about twenty more untrained Grade III women clerks. To put
                himself in a really adequate position to deal with any likely demands he will
                want a good many more.</p>
     <section id="first">2. Military and Air Force Enigma (Hut 6)</section>
    <p>We are intercepting quite a substantial proportion of wireless traYc in the
                Middle East which cannot be picked up by our intercepting stations here. This
                contains among other things a good deal of new ‘Light Blue’ intelligence. Owing
                to shortage of trained typists, however, and the fatigue of our present decoding staV, we cannot get all this traYc decoded. This has been the state of aVairs
                since May. Yet all that we need to put matters right is about twenty trained
                typists.</p>
    <section id="first">3. Bombe testing, Hut 6 and Hut 8</section>
    <p>In July we were promised that the testing of the ‘stories’ produced by the bombes
                would be taken over by the WRNS in the bombe hut and that suYcient WRNS
                would be provided for this purpose. It is now late in October and nothing
                has been done. We do not wish to stress this so strongly as the two preceding
                points, because it has not actually delayed us in delivering the goods. It has,
                however, meant that staV in Huts 6 and 8 who are needed for other jobs have
                had to do the testing themselves. We cannot help feeling that with a Service
                matter of this kind it should have been possible to detail a body of WRNS for
                this purpose, if suYciently urgent instructions had been sent to the right
                quarters.</p>
    <section id="fourth">4.</section>
    <p> Apart altogether from staV matters, there are a number of other directions
                in which it seems to us that we have met with unnecessary impediments. It
                would take too long to set these out in full, and we realise that some of the
                matters involved are controversial. The cumulative eVect, however, has been to
                drive us to the conviction that the importance of the work is not being impressed
                with suYcient force upon those outside authorities with whom we have to
                deal.
                We have written this letter entirely on our own initiative. We do not know
                who or what is responsible for our diYculties, and most emphatically we do
                not want to be taken as criticising Commander Travis who has all along done
                his utmost to help us in every possible way. But if we are to do our job as well
                as it could and should be done it is absolutely vital that our wants, small as they
                are, should be promptly attended to. We have felt that we should be failing in our duty if we did not draw your attention to the facts and to the eVects which
                they are having and must continue to have on our work, unless immediate action
                is taken</p>
